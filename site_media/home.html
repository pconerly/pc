<h2 class="homepage-title">Background</h2>
<p>In May of 2009 I graduated from <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a> with a B.S. in Biochemistry (with Honors and with a minor in Entrepreneurship). In early 2010 I worked at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Dr. Shou's lab. I had the opportunity to program with R (the statistical language) and LabView (to automate a microscope). I hadn't programmed in some years, and I was reminded how much fun it was! I will always love biology, but I decided to pursue computer science as a career.</p>
<p>Since then I left the 'Hutch' and was contracting at Google with their Maps team. I provided internal tech support, which includes tracking and reporting bugs to the software engineers.</p>
<p>In Februrary 2011 I got fierce position at Tag Creative Studio and am ramping up my skills there!
<a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/">The UW Professional & Continuing Education</a> department provides a Certification in Python programming which I completed in May 2011.</p>
