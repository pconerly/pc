<p>Descriptions of the projects (professional and personal) that I have worked on.</p>
<h3 id="portfolio-title" class="bordercolor color1">IE Gallery</h3>
<p>IE Gallery, or “Internet Explorer Gallery”, is the library of bookmarks, add-ons and tracking protection lists that can be added to IE7, IE8 and IE9.  Think of it as the Firefox Add-ons site, but for Internet Explorer.  This website gets 20 million user per month.</p>
<p>Microsoft leadership is constantly looking to improve the site, and Tag Creative’s design & development team is brainstorming and assisting them in creating the best user experience possible.  I spend the majority of my time at Tag Creative maintaining and upgrading IE Gallery.  At this point my fingerprints are on most pieces of the site, and I hold institutional memory of it’s codebase.</p>
<p>The legacy codebase we were handed in February 2011 was .NET 2.0 and it was running on rackspace server.  Under our guidance we have upgraded it to .NET 4.0, moved the hosting to Windows Azure, and completely redesigned the look and interaction of the site.  Tag Creative started a rewrite in November 2011 to .NET MVC, and I’m one of two senior developers on the project.  (The other developer is the talented <a href="http://www.evanrosebrook.com/">Evan Rosebrook</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="portfolio-title" class="bordercolor color1">KEXP for Android</h3>
<p>I’ve wanted to build an android app for awhile, so I was pumped when I heard that we had an android app that needed to get coded.  KEXP radio already had an iPhone app, but they had come to Tag Creative for design & development on an android app.  I worked with Jason Kopec (a phenomenal designer at Tag) to create this app.</p>
<p>The chief challenge in this project was that didn’t know anyone who programmed android at the time.  I found some Seattle android devs (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jack-chatterton/2/895/829">Jack Chatterton</a> especially) and extensively used stackoverflow for help.  This was mostly a solo mission and I’ve learned that I prefer to work with other programmers, if only to share in the misery of being stumped.</p>
<p>You can download the app <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=org.kexp.radio">here</a>. </p>
<h3 id="portfolio-title" class="bordercolor color1">IMography</h3>
<p>Short for "Instant-Message-ography". Users can upload their AIM (Aol Instant Messenger) log files and get a graph of the words exchange per day. I was inspired to do this by my own logs -over four years worth- which I wanted meta-data from. An example follows (<a href="http://imography.com/data/aeaf83f6846511690202c1395f662945/">more detail on this example</a>):</p>

<h3 id="portfolio-title" class="bordercolor color1">Project Euler</h3>
<p>From their website: "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." The image below shows how many I've solved!</p>
